# test-ssh-key
This repo exists to make sure students have Git and a GitHub SSH key configured correctly on their computers.

If you can clone this repo and push changes back up to it, you're all set.

If you can't do both of those things, see GitHub's instructions for setting up an SSH key at https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
